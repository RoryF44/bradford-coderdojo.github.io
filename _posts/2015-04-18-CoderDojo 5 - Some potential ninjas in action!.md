Nathan and Emily have attended 3 CoderDojos. Nathan enjoyed writing some programs and animations using Scratch Junior on an iPad. At the last session he learnt how to create some simple 3D objects using the free resource Tinkercad [www.tinkercad.com](http://www.tinkercad.com) and today he is continuing to work on Tinkercad creating a monster based on a chicken and an egg. Once completed he can export the design and use the 3D printer to print his design.

Emily Worked on Kodu [www.kodugamelab.com](http://www.kodugamelab.com) the first week. Kodu is a free resource from Microsoft that allows the quick creation of worlds and objects that can be simply programmed to interact with each other as a game.  Emilyâ€™s game was an obstacle course and was great fun to make and play. In the last session Emily did some work on Tinkercad and Minecraft and today she is updating her blog.
