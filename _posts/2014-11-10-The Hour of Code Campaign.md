During the week of December 8th – 14th, we are supporting the Hour of Code campaign.
Last year 15 million students tried computer science in one week around the world and since March over 3 million students have tried an hour of code in the UK.
This time the target is to reach 100 million students globally!
The aim of the Hour of Code is to demystify that coding is just for geeks and boys and introduce students, teachers and parents in a fun way to computational thinking. We expect that the Hour of Code will have a beneficial impact preparing students and teachers for the new Computing Curriculum.
We would like to encourage as many schools as possible around the UK to sign up their students to try an Hour of Code.
Schools can see themselves represented on the map on http://hourofcode.com/uk
Every teacher who signs up their class will receive 10GB of dropbox storage or $10 worth of Skype credit.
The Hour of Code is a global movement reaching tens of millions of students in 180+ countries. It provides an hour of free tutorial and interactive resources across a range of computing languages aimed at all ages and is completely free!
